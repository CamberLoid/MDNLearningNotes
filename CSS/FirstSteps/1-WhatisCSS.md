# What is CSS
## What is CSS for
CSS is a language for specifying how documents presented to users - how they styled, laid out, etc.

> Note: A browser is sometimes called a *user agent*

## Syntax
CSS is a rule-based language.  
Example:
```css
h1/*Selector*/ {
    color: red; /*Declarations/声明*/
    font-size/*Properties*/: 5em/*Values*/;
}
```
Properties have different **allowable** values.
